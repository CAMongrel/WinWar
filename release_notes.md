# WinWar
## Release Notes
### 0.2.4
WinWar now uses .NET Core 2.2. This means that there is currently no difference between 
the common desktop platforms: Windows, Linux and macOS. They all use the same project and
code base.  
On the other hand, I dropped support for iOS for now. It requires a good touch implementation 
anyway, but I don't want to waste time on that now.
