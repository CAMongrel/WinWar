            Used as a parent view controller for iOS 5 (and older) Game Center view controllers.
            No longer used for iOS 6+ because it's unnecessary and generates runtime warnings.
            (See comments for ShowGuideViewController below for more information.)

            <summary>
            Shows guide view controllers, e.g., Game Center view controllers.
            In iOS 5 and older, the guide is presented using GuideViewController.
            In iOS 6+, the guide is presented using the root view controller.
            (The iOS 5 method generates runtime warnings.)
