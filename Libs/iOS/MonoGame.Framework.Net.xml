            Used as a parent view controller for iOS 5 (and older) Game Center view controllers.
            No longer used for iOS 6+ because it's unnecessary and generates runtime warnings.
            (See comments for ShowGuideViewController below for more information.)

            Shows guide view controllers, e.g., Game Center view controllers.

            (The iOS 5 method generates runtime warnings.)
