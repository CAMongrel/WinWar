WinWar is a multiplatform (Windows, Windows Modern UI, OSX, Linux) port of the original DOS WarCraft: Orcs & Humans PC Game. It is completely rewritten from scratch using only the original art and level data.

It REQUIRES the original game; no game data is included. Since version 0.2.0 WinWar is compatible with the demo version, which you can find here:
